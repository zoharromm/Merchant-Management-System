Deer live in small groups, usually only the mother and her calves. The males have magnificent antlers and live in small groups of three or four animals. Both male and female deer have a red-brown coat in the summer and a grey one in the winter.

MTYSSGRP_511	Schleich Golden Retriever Puppy	Golden retrievers are companionable, playful dogs and therefore very popular. Originally they were English hunting dogs. The golden retriever, one of the most popular dog breeds, has a long history. The credit for the development of this breed is due to Lord Tweedmouth, who wanted to breed a strong, but gentle dog. Golden retrievers are the perfect family dog and need only daily exercise and sufficient attention. These sociable and sporty dogs have a friendly character. They like to swim and carry things in their mouths - take care where you put your shoes!  Create your animal world with Schleich Wild Life figures.

MTYSSWF_514	Schleich White-Tailed Fawn	This small, widespread deer species from North America gets its name from its white tail. The white-tailed deer is the symbol for nine states in the USA and two Canadian provinces. White-tailed deer graze mornings and evenings. They are herbivores and feed on green plants and nuts. Deer live in small groups, usually only the mother and her calves. The males have magnificent antlers and live in small groups of three or four animals. Both male and female deer have a red-brown coat in the summer and a grey one in the winter. Because they now have almost no natural enemies, deer populations are sometimes so large that they cannot find enough to eat. Deer are ruminant animals like cows, which means they have four stomachs. This allows the deer to eat twigs which most animals cannot digest.  Create your animal world with Schleich Wild Life figures.
