SGC1097prnt	Ultra Quick-Dry Towel	Light-weight  quick-drying towels are perfect for swimming  snorkeling  scuba diving  traveling  camping  hiking  or everyday use. The lightweight moisture-management fabric pulls the water from your skin. When the moisture reaches the outside of the fabric  it spreads out to many times its original surface area  enabling it to evaporate very quickly. This fabric dries 3 times faster than cotton  yet it is so lightweight it looks almost sheer. Made with a special technology that discourages bacterial growth which nearly eliminates the stink you get with cotton towels. Use the towel as a cover-up at the beach as it also boasts SPF sun protection anywhere from 15-40  depending on color (the darker the color  the higher the SPF). Use the towel as a blanket on airplanes or roadtrips. Machine wash  hang to dry.
