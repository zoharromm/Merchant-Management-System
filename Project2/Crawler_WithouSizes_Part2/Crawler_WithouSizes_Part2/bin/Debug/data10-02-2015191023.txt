ST4GAM0_2233	011	It's year "'011'" in an alternative 19th century. The Inscrutable Organ of Eternity is hidden somewhere in Turin, and it's the only instrument that can prevent the coming Ragnarök. Only one of the 8 Characters in the game is the "Chosen One" who can play the Organ. One of the others, meanwhile, has been possessed by the Spirit of Fenrir the Wolf, and will try to prevent the Chosen One from reaching the Organ.The goal of the game, is to identify and deliver the Chosen One and the song of Making (which is composed as part of the game play) to the Inscrutable Organ of Eternity before the 12th hour.011 is played over 11 rounds, called Hours. Each Hour is divided into 5 phases. All players, in order, must complete one phase, before the next phase begins: 1. Reveal Event, 2. Bid for Turn Order, 3. Place Clues on the Map, 4. Character Actions and Movement, and 5. Play Location Tiles. Once all 5 Phases are complete, advance the Hour Hand one space on the Ragnarök Clock. If the Hand reaches XII (and so, the 11th Hour has passed), the game ends and all players lose! Otherwise, a new Round begins with Phase 1.		401 Games	401 Games	48.95	CDN	2	http://store.401games.ca//img/product/id=251877

ST4GAM1AGMD_2278	1st & Goal - Mideast Division	1st & Goal: Mideast Division, an expansion for 1st & Goal, contains 28 dice that make up four custom teams. The Dice Football League (DFL) Mideast division includes the following teams:Birmingham Black Widows - The Black Widows enter the league of 24 inaugural teams with a top 10-ranked running and passing games. Despite a strong offense, the Black Widows are in danger of getting stomped on defense. Coach Harris Gray states, "We spent all our money on offense. Our defensive squad is pretty much all volunteers." Nose Guard Mildred Dinkins had this to say: "I just go out there every Sunday and do my best. Can I say 'hi' to my grandson?"Columbus Cobras - The Cobras enter the league with the 10th-ranked running game and the 16th-ranked passing game. Not only do the Cobras enter the league with a top-ten running game, their defense stands at 9th in the rankings and is one of the most consistent. Coach Bobby "Bam" Boozell states, "I'm so proud of our defense. That's a tough group of young men. They may not be the best out there, but we rarely have any surprises." As mentioned, the Cobras have a top tier running game, led by running back, Cole Kutz. Mr. Kutz had not released a statement by press time. Rumors report that he was out looking for a sandwich endorsement.Scranton Scorchers - The Scorchers enter the league with the 7th-ranked running game and the 19th-ranked passing game. Despite an inconsistent offense, the Scorchers have a top eleven defense. Coach Gus Tufwin states, "Right now I'm afraid our passing game blows. But our defense comes in like a hurricane, so hold on to your hats!" Wide Receiver Buddy Fingers commented: "Coach makes a lot of noise about our passing problems, but I'm quick as lightning, man, fast as the wind. I just have a problem holding on to the ball sometimes."Toronto Thunder - The Thunder enter the league with the 17th-ranked running game and a bottom ranked passing game. Despite a weak offense, the Thunder have a top ten defense. Coac...		401 Games	401 Games	12.95	CDN	3	http://store.401games.ca//img/product/id=251916
