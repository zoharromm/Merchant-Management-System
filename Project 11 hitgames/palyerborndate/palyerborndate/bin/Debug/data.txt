CHCHCBSHS_331	Cooksville Bulgarian Style Hot Sauce	Bulgarian Style Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) We were on a trip to Bulgaria in 2007 and I noted the use of certain spices, predominantly mountain grown savory, in most of the dishes we were served. I tried adding these to peppers and came up with a pretty good sauce. My lovely wife Mariana, who hails from that region, said that adding tomatoes would bring out the taste I was looking for. Before I could even attempt to put a case together about how the sauce was good as is, she had added her magic touches and came up with this recipe. Marianaâ€™s mom, Yovka, has a trademark recipe that blends tomatoes, cumin and hand rubbed savory which adds just the perfect amount of pizzazz to any of the amazing dishes she creates. This is another unique sauce that goes great with pretty much everything. The label features the Bulgarian national colors and coat of arms. Ingredients: hot peppers, tomatoes, vinegar, water, salt, lemon juice, spices.

CHCHCCHS_332	Cooksville Chipotle Hot Sauce	Chipotle Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) This sauce is a fiery blend of garlic and smoked Mexican peppers.

Itâ€™s a traditional recipe used in cooking in the south western part of the state. We slow smoke our peppers over charcoal, mesquite, cherry and apple woods.This is a great sauce for adding flavor to traditional bean dishes, stews and soups. The label features our smallest parrot, Zac. Ingredients: smoked chilies, jalapeno peppers, habanero peppers, garlic, salt, cider, malt vinegar, water.

It holds the record for the hottest temperature ever recorded in the western hemisphere; 56.7 degrees Celsius (134 Fahrenheit) on July 10, 1913 at Furnace Creek. We use the hottest chilies we can find and blend them with other delicious ingredients used in locale fare from around the Mojave region to bring you a truly great sauce.

CHCHCEHS_334	Cooksville Extreme Hot Sauce	Extreme Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) The heat of peppers vary due to the climate theyâ€™re grown in.

Made from Scotch Bonnet peppers, it delivers a serious kick with that smoky flavour that these peppers are noted for. Ingredients: scotch bonnet, habanero, vinegar, water, salt.

CHCHCGDHS_335	Cooksville Garlic & Dill Hot Sauce	Garlic  Dill Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) Another great idea. We both have European heritage. Mariana more so than me because she is actually from Europe.

And make a lot of dill pickles.Why not mix them both with peppers rather than cucumbers and see what happens. The result was an instant hit.

CHCHCGCHS_336	Cooksville Green Chili Hot Sauce	Green Chili Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) The second recipe to follow the red sauce was naturally a green one.

CHCHCHHHS_353	Cooksville Hawaiian Heat Hot Sauce	Hawaiian Heat Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) This was a no brainer for us. Watching our kids order pizza one night (we have six boys so thereâ€™s always a lot of variation on the pizza theme) we noticed that the twins had a penchant for pineapple and hot peppers on theirs. Taking this idea (minus the pizza) and turning into a hot sauce we scored a winner. We even grew a crop of peppers native to the islands to get an idea about the flavour. We have been told that this sauce works on everything from fruit salad (no kidding!) to baked ham. Recently we were in a bar in Streetsville, Ontario and they brought us a plate of wings with our sauce on it. It tasted amazing. Try your own variation and let us know.

CHCHCUSHS_360	Cooksville UK Style Hot Sauce	UK Style Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) I tried a home made concoction once at a World Cup Soccer party that a British friend of mine was throwing. I am not sure of what kind of peppers it had in it, but mustard was a key ingredient, and this was the condiment for the â€œbangers and mashâ€ he was serving. It nearly took my head off. We decided to take this concept to the next level and came up with our own version. Use this where ever you would use mustard but require a little more â€œfireâ€.

CHCHGW4PGB_520	Get Wasted â€“ 4 Pack Gift Box	Get Wasted includes: Arrogant Double Bastard Double Burn HabaÃ±ero Hot Sauce - 6 oz. - A sauce almost as big as the beer that's in it - ALMOST. Merciful beings that we are we chose to utilize none other than HabaÃ±eros to dilute it. If you're tasting this hot sauce as you read this you either love HabaÃ±eros or you just lost a bet. (Not yet personally familiar with HabaÃ±eros? No matter, it's a s-h-o-r-t learning curve). Double Bastard Ale Double Burn HabaÃ±ero is a surprisingly well balanced hot sauce to those fire eaters who love HabaÃ±eros, and a singular pain to those who are unworthy. "Introduced in 1997, Arrogant Bastard Ale immediately developed a following among "those who know" (a.k.a. "the Worthy"). Arrogant Bastard Ale is an aggressive beer and not for the timid or weak. As such, it demands pairing with food that takes the same stance. So when our similarly (and appropriately) arrogant friends at Carlsbad Gourmet approached us to collaborate on a hot sauce recipe made with Arrogant Bastard, not only did we say yes - we said, "Let's make three!" From California Ingredients: Double Bastard Ale, tomato paste, vinegar, honey, lemon juice, evaporated cane juice, salt, garlic powder, crushed red peppers, Capsicum, HabaÃ±ero pepper powder, soybean oil. Wild Turkey HabaÃ±ero Hot Sauce - 6oz. - The famous name on this bottle comes from a group of wild turkey hunters, one of whom brought a special barrel-aged bourbon on their annual hunting trip. In later years they always requested "that Wild Turkey bourbon" and today it is still hand-crafted in the same slow traditional way. It also perfectly enhances this real Kentucky fiery HabaÃ±ero sauce, which is made with the finest ingredients. From Kentucky Ingredients:  Cayenne peppers, HabaÃ±ero peppers, JalapeÃ±o peppers, vinegar, tomato paste, Wild Turkey Bourbon, sugar, salt, natural flavorings, garlic.

BAPEPMD_157	PTS Enhanced Polymer Mag - DE	The PTSÂ® Enhanced Polymer Magazine, or EPM for short, is a new type of mid-capacity polymer magazine for AEGs. The EPM is a truly unique AEG magazine, inside and out. Externally it features a Dupont Zytel polymer shell, with recessed panels for better grip, and unique magazine well guides that reduce snagging when the magazine is drawn from and reinserted into pouches. The bullet window with the fake 556 rounds isn't just for show. When the magazine is fully loaded, at the base of the see-through bullet window, an orange follower comes into view. This is a remarkable design feature unique to the EPM as it allows the end user to pick up any EPM magazine and immediately know if the magazine is filled to capacity and ready to go. It also acts a visual indicator for the user to known when to stop loading the magazine. Another notable feature of the magazine is the base plate. The bottom of the base plate has been designed with an angled surface and a rubber overmold on the lower face. This combination of features allows the end user to rest the gun on any flat shooting platform and have more surface contact with better traction and therefore greater stability. The angled surface is minimized to the point that it is functional, yet still comfortable in the hand when drawn from pouches and also does not inhibit the closure of flaps on closed top magazine pouches. The heel of the base plate has also been designed with a ribbed ledge which promotes easier extraction of the magazine from deep magazine pouches and can help the end user with correctly indexing the magazine. This mid capacity AEG magazine holds 150 rounds with the same reliability that all PTS magazines have long been famous for. It is compatible with Version 2 based M4 AEGs by TM, G&G, C-TAC, KWA, and Lucid. It is also compatible with the Version 2 based VFC 416 and CA 416.	<ul id="product-attribute-specs-table" class="data-table" cellspacing="0"><li class=""><span class="label">For Rifles</span><span class="data">M4/ M16</span></li><li class="bl br"><span class="label">Capacity</span><span class="data">Mid-Cap</span></li></ul>			34.99	CDN	Y	https://www.buyairsoft.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/780x439/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/s/i/side2_2.jpg	https://www.buyairsoft.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/780x439/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/s/i/side_5.jpg

BAPEPMB_189	PTS Enhanced Polymer Mag - Black	The PTSÂ® Enhanced Polymer Magazine, or EPM for short, is a new type of mid-capacity polymer magazine for AEGs. The EPM is a truly unique AEG magazine, inside and out. Externally it features a Dupont Zytel polymer shell, with recessed panels for better grip, and unique magazine well guides that reduce snagging when the magazine is drawn from and reinserted into pouches. The bullet window with the fake 556 rounds isn't just for show. When the magazine is fully loaded, at the base of the see-through bullet window, an orange follower comes into view. This is a remarkable design feature unique to the EPM as it allows the end user to pick up any EPM magazine and immediately know if the magazine is filled to capacity and ready to go. It also acts a visual indicator for the user to known when to stop loading the magazine. Another notable feature of the magazine is the base plate. The bottom of the base plate has been designed with an angled surface and a rubber overmold on the lower face. This combination of features allows the end user to rest the gun on any flat shooting platform and have more surface contact with better traction and therefore greater stability. The angled surface is minimized to the point that it is functional, yet still comfortable in the hand when drawn from pouches and also does not inhibit the closure of flaps on closed top magazine pouches. The heel of the base plate has also been designed with a ribbed ledge which promotes easier extraction of the magazine from deep magazine pouches and can help the end user with correctly indexing the magazine. This mid capacity AEG magazine holds 150 rounds with the same reliability that all PTS magazines have long been famous for. It is compatible with Version 2 based M4 AEGs by TM, G&G, C-TAC, KWA, and Lucid. It is also compatible with the Version 2 based VFC 416 and CA 416.	<ul id="product-attribute-specs-table" class="data-table" cellspacing="0"><li class=""><span class="label">For Rifles</span><span class="data">M4/ M16</span></li><li class="bl br"><span class="label">Capacity</span><span class="data">Mid-Cap</span></li></ul>			34.99	CDN	N	https://www.buyairsoft.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/780x439/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/s/i/side2_3.jpg	https://www.buyairsoft.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/780x439/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/s/i/side_7.jpg	https://www.buyairsoft.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/780x439/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/i/m/img8_1.png

BAFP8_453	FrogLube Paste 8oz.	FrogLube can be used on airsoft internal components such as gears, pistons, piston head o-rings, cylinder head o-rings, and more. FrogLube CLP will actually seep into the materials and draw out imperfections in the metal and condition the rubber. Remember to use a heat source such as a lamp or hair dryer while applying FrogLube to ensure the lubricant can be absorbed into the materials. FrogLube penetrates deep into the surface it contacts. Once dry, the surface will become slick to the touch. During firing, the lube will "wick" to the surface and provide a slippery and wet appearance to glide surfaces and hot spots. FrogLube is a heavy specific gravity food grade substance that creeps deep into the micro fissures of the metal and acts as if to â€˜seasonâ€™ the surface of any friction points and all areas treated with the lube. Since FrogLube is non-corrosive to plastics and rubber, it is the preferred lubricant and preservative for O-rings, non-ferrous and rubber parts. FrogLube will actually condition O-rings and improve air compression.

BAFCS_465	FrogLube Clamshell System	The FrogLube Clamshell is now available! This kit has everything for the new FrogLube user. Because this kit is packaged with FrogLube solvent, we only recommend it to be used with real firearms. FrogLube can be used on airsoft internal components such as gears, pistons, piston head o-rings, cylinder head o-rings, and more. FrogLube CLP will actually seep into the materials and draw out imperfections in the metal and condition the rubber. Remember to use a heat source such as a lamp or hair dryer while applying FrogLube to ensure the lubricant can be absorbed into the materials. FrogLube penetrates deep into the surface it contacts. Once dry, the surface will become slick to the touch. During firing, the lube will "wick" to the surface and provide a slippery and wet appearance to glide surfaces and hot spots. FrogLube is a heavy specific gravity food grade substance that creeps deep into the micro fissures of the metal and acts as if to â€˜seasonâ€™ the surface of any friction points and all areas treated with the lube. Since FrogLube CLP is non-corrosive to plastics and rubber, it is the preferred lubricant and preservative for O-rings, non-ferrous and rubber parts. FrogLube will actually condition O-rings and improve air compression.

BO184	Japanese water stone sharpener	Boker Japanese water stone coarse (600 grit). For reshaping dull blades or small nicks in the blade 7" x 2" x 3/4".The secret of the world-famous sharpness and edge retention of Japanese blades is based on the quality of the steel and the manufacturing processes that were brought to perfection over hundreds of years. Nevertheless, even the best blades need some care and maintenance on a regular basis.

CS95SMB	Sjambok	In Africa, the Sjambok (Sham-Bawk) is a cattle prod, a whip, a riding crop and a means of self-protection and unlike most western style whips, the Sjambok is not plaited from thin leather thongs. Instead, it is carved whole out of very thick Hippopotamus hide and it is considerable reach, lightning speed and devastating impact have built it quite a reputation as a sure defense against deadly snakes. Since the Sjambok is swung like a rod or stick and not cracked like a conventional western style whip, the weight, speed and flexibility of the Sjambok&acute;s lash does all the work and little skill is required to wield it effectively.Today Hippo hide is pretty scarce and not commercially viable, so Cold Steel has decided to make a synthetic version of the classic Sjambok. Featuring a thick, beefy lash, injection molded from polypropylene and equipped with a soft comfortable Kraton handle designed to resemble braided leather, our synthetic Sjambok rivals the look and performance of even the most expensive originals. What&acute;s more since it&acute;s made entirely from super tough plastic it&acute;s impervious to the elements and will never break, crack, shrink or mildew like leather is prone to do.Keep a Sjambok handy in your vehicle. Lay it across the dash, stash it behind the seat or toss it in the bed, trunk or boot. Hang one on the wall near the door of your home, shop, barn, coop or kennel. And don&acute;t forget to loop one over your saddle horn every time you go riding, as our Sjambok is sure to be the most useful and effective whip you have ever owned.	<ul><li>Overall Length:42"</li><li>Handle:Black Kraton handle</li><li>This item is:OVERSIZE SHIPPING</li></ul>	Cold Steel	Cold Steel	23.93	CDN	Y	http://www.knifezone.ca/pictures/coldsteel/images/cs95smbcoldsteelblacksjambok.jpg

Their hollow handles will accept survival supplies or a variety of handle extensions which can maximize reach, leverage or ease of throwing. They are available in two blade styles (standard and our new Bowie point) and both feature continuously curved blades that are ideal for skinning, and will pierce, cut, slash, slice and shear like you won&acute;t believe.This version is the Cold Steel bushman which has an overall length of 12 1/4&quot; and the The bushman blade itself is 7&quot; long.

CS91WAS	Cold Steel African Walking Stick	Cold Steel African Walking Stick is 36 1/2" overall with a Constructed of solid black polypropylene. Based on the Zulu Kerrie, this walking stick has an undulating shaft and a geodesic knob, and it weighs 25.3 oz with a 2 3/4 Head, a 1 3/4" Neck, and a 1 1/4" BaseThe Zulus are perhaps the fiercest, most combative tribe in all South Africa and in the early 1800&acute;s the Zulu King, Shaka, subjugated the vast area of land between the Phongolo and Mzimkhulu rivers and laid the foundations for the Zulu Nation. Then in 1879 the Zulus handed the British one of the most humiliating defeats in history at the battle of Isandlwana, when they annihilated an entire column of 1200 Englishmen (who were supported by artillery and cavalry), and did it with little more than cowhide shields and their Assegais, or short stabbing spears and even to this day, a Zulu tribesman is nobody to be trifled with.The thing that distinguishes the Zulu people most is their fondness for using a Knob Kerrie, or walking stick and Cold Steelâ€™s President, Lynn C. Thompson, who regularly hunts in South Africa, has amassed an impressive collection of these handmade sticks. Most of them are made from indigenous African hardwoods like Wild Olive, Pink Ivory, and Red Bush Willow, and are topped with a distinctive ball or knob.Adapted for the western marketplace, the Cold Steel African Walking Stick features some of the best parts of traditional Zulu Kerries like an undulating shaft, and the traditional geodesic ball grip. However, instead of using a costly exotic hardwood, we&acute;ve made ours out of black Polypropylene. This means that, in addition to being unbreakable, it&acute;s also impervious to the elements. It will never rot, warp, crack, splinter, swell, shrink, mildew or fade, and it&acute;s ready for all the wear and tear you, and the world, can dish out. Although its primary mission is to be a walking stick to aid oneâ€™s balance when crossing uneven, slippery, wet or rough terrain, it ca...	<ul><li>Overall Length:36 1/2"</li><li>Weight:25.3 oz</li><li>Steel Edge:Constructed of solid black polypropylene</li><li>This item is:OVERSIZE SHIPPING</li></ul>	Cold Steel	Cold Steel	57.27	CDN	Y	http://www.knifezone.ca/pictures/coldsteel/images/cs91wascoldsteelafricanwalking.jpg

CS90RH	rifleman hawk tomahawks axe	Cold Steel CS90RH Riflemans tomahawks axe is 19" overall with a black coated tomahawks axe head with 3 1/2" cutting edge. It comes with a Hickory handleThese superb tomahawks are precision drop forged from 1055 Carbon steel. Drop forging is the best method of manufacture for any impact weapon, particularly one with a cutting edge.In the forging process a metal ingot is heated almost white hot and then formed into shape in a series of progressive dies. The large steel dies are fixed to huge compressed air hammers. Each die hammers the hot metal into a gradually more finished shape. The steel is kneaded and compressed into a mass making the grain structure uniform and minimizing gas pockets or other imperfections that can ruin the construction of a hand forged hawk.These tomahawks are differentially heat treated. This means that the cutting edge and hammer face is fully hardened, while the balance is left relatively soft to absorb the shock of striking blows.	<ul><li>Overall Length:19"</li><li>Cutting edge:2 1/4"</li><li>Steel:drop forged 5150 steel</li><li>Handle:Hickory</li></ul>	Cold Steel	Cold Steel	59.93	CDN	Y	http://www.knifezone.ca/pictures/coldsteel/images/coldsteelaxe.jpg

CS21S	Cold Steel Spartan knife	Cold Steel Spartan knife has a 6" closed lockback with an AUS-8A stainless blade with easy open thumb plate and it incorporates the Tri-Ad locking mechanism, which has tested to be almost impervious to stress, strain and shock. It has black injection molded Grivory handles. Black finish stainless pocket clip and it also comes with extra pocket clip.The word Spartan conjures up the vivid history of the battle of Thermopylae, a story of enormous courage in the face of devastating odds. The Spartans were a tough breed, trained from childhood in the art of war and inured to most privations, both mental and physical. Engaging them at close quarters was something to be feared and avoided, as their famous Kopis swords struck off arms and legs like a scythe in a wheat field! Designed by Andrew Demko, the Cold Steel Spartanâ„¢ is a folding Kopis scaled down to accommodate the demands of a tamer, more sophisticated world. The 4 1/2" blade evokes the classic Kopis of the ancients with its characteristic recurved edge, big belly and sharp, acute point. It&acute;s hollow ground from Japanese AUS 8A stainless and has some similarities with a Kukri. Like the Kukri, the Spartanâ„¢ always presents its edge at an angle to the material being cut to produce a deep sheering effect. However, since its point is narrower and more acute than most Kukri blades, it stabs almost as well as it cuts and the Spartanâ„¢ also echoes the ancient Kopis in its handle.It&acute;s designed to help the hand resist the pull of centrifugal force and to retard forward momentum, when stabbing, or backward movement, when hammering or smashing with its pommel. The injection is molded out of Grivory with steel liners for strength, itâ€™s heavily contoured for comfort and features irregular fluting and a heavily textured surface finish for an exceptionally effective grip.The Spartanâ„¢ has dual pocket clips to assure ambidextrous carry and for quick draw opening, it features a thumb plate that can be used to o...	<ul><li>Blade Length:6"</li><li>Steel Edge:AUS-8A stainless</li><li>Handle:Black injection molded Grivory handles</li><li>Clip:Black finish stainless pocket clip</li></ul>	Cold Steel	Cold Steel	153.27	CDN	N	http://www.knifezone.ca/pictures/coldsteel/images/cs21scoldsteelspartan.jpg

It has been designed to specifically mimic a traditional balisong knife or butterfly knife in every respect but one it can&acute;t be opened with one hand! The leaf shaped blade is hollow ground from imported Japanese AUS 8A stainless steel and, due to the latest advances in heat treatment, it offers a thin, ultra keen edge that lasts.It&acute;s twin handles feature two integral springs are designed to rotate 180 degrees around the blade&acute;s unique split tang and use strong opposing spring tension to lock the blade open or hold it firmly closed.

CS88ITS	Cold Steel Italian Long Sword	The era of the long sword spanned almost three centuries (approximately 1350 to 1650). This, undoubtedly, was because it really worked! It featured a distinctive cruciform hilt and a long, double edged blade and was equally adept at opposing both light and heavily armored foes. You see, its extra long blade offered the reach and leverage for powerful stabbing, cutting and chopping strokes while its long cross guard and heavy pommel were useful for hooking, striking and smashing. When heavy plate armor was encountered, blows with the edge were marginally effective and were often abandoned in favor of a "Half-Swording" technique; where one hand grips the hilt and the other the blade to better direct the point in powerful jabs, and to more accurately thrust at the small gaps and joints present in a suit of armor.Having read S.M. Stirling's "Change" series of science fiction novels about a world that loses 600 years of technological evolution overnight (an event called "The Change") at least a dozen times each, has left our President Lynn C. Thompson quite taken with the many virtues of the Long Sword and inspired him to make a Cold Steel variation.Modeled on the Italian concept of sword design, the blade and balance slightly favors thrusting attacks, however, its cutting edges are astonishingly effective too and can deliver some down right ferocious blows. Additionally, its simple cruciform hilt is also all business with a long upturned cross guard, leather-over-wood grip, and a counter balancing fish tail pommel. Fast as a frog's tongue the Italian Sword is deadly in a fight and built like a tank.	<ul><li>Steel:1055 carbon</li><li>Weight:142.1 oz</li><li>Blade Length:35 1/2"</li><li>Overall Length:45"</li><li>This item is:OVERSIZE SHIPPING</li></ul>	Cold Steel	Cold Steel	586.60	CDN	Y	http://www.knifezone.ca/pictures/coldsteel/images/italianlongsword.jpg

The Ka-Bar trademark was introduced in the 1920's and around 1942 the company submited a Ka-Bar branded knife to the U. S. Marine Corps. The Ka-Bar knife became so well known and so important to the company, that in 1952 the company name was changed to Ka-Bar Cutlery, Inc.These knives are marked with some of the same marks used in the early 20th Century.This knife is constructed with 440C Stainless Steel blades ground flat with a hardness of 56-58 Rc.

Start to open the knife, and let Aegis finish the action with a bang, using one of the surest assisted technologies (S.A.T.) out there! The trademark bayonet reversible clip, built in safety with red/ready to go, checkered DigiGrip handles, and tacky rubber inserts all contribute to make Aegis a platform for today&acute;s changing world. Cover your back with Aegis outdoor or tactical blades.Cryogenic Heat Treatment - SOG&acute;s unique cryogenic heat treatment process increases the toughness and wear resistance of our blades. Taking the knife slowly down in temperature to less than -300 Degrees F and then back to room temperature. This stress relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength as well as edge retention. Knife edges stay sharp longer with significantly less micro-fracturing and edge-chipping. Its this dedication to making your knife SOG sharp that sets us apart from the rest.SOG Assisted Technology works through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs. As one opens the blade the force to propel the knife open becomes greater than the closing force and the blade will open on its own. The end result propels the blade out once the operator has initiated the one-handed opening action.S.A.T. works so well that right-handers can use their left hand equally well to open a folding knife (of course this works oppositely for lefties).	<ul><li>Weight:2 oz.</li><li>Blade Thickness:0.11"</li><li>Blade Length:3"</li><li>Blade Edge:Half Serrated Tanto</li><li>Blade Material:AUS-8 stainless</li><li>Blade Hardness:Rockwell 57-58</li><li>Overall Length:7"</li><li>Handle:GRN DigiGrip</li><li>Clip:Reversible</li><li>Finish:Black TiNi</li></ul>	SOG	SOG	119.95	CDN	Y	http://www.knifezone.ca/pictures/sog/images/SOG99553miniagisblack.jpg

This tool is designed to be a companion tool for a small folding or â€˜Mora typeâ€™ knife. It is intended to take on the heavy chiseling and prying uses that the lighter knives can not handle, without becoming so overly large and cumbersome that it is left behind when most needed. The ambidextrous handle and chisel with one side rounded and one side square is specially designed to make primitive tools such as bows, arrows, bowls, etc from natural materials. In use it is used similar to a chisel or gouge to carve out bowls, spoons and other useful items. It can be driven into a tree with a baton to cut it down or split it without fear of breaking the handle as some hidden tang knives do. The â€˜SHANGOâ€™ style firesteel and arrow shaft scraper is a TOPS exclusive. The blunt tip is compliant with safety regulations for most youth wilderness trekking programs.	<ul><li>Overall Length:8â€</li><li>Blade Length:3 1/2â€</li><li>Steel Edge:1095 high carbon</li><li>Sheath:Kydex</li><li>Finish:Traction coating</li><li>Extras:Whistle,piggy back fire starter, Lansky Quick-Fix sharpener</li></ul>	Tops Knives	Tops Knives	159.93	CDN	Y	http://www.knifezone.ca/pictures/topsknives/images/tpjst01topsjensensurvivaltool.jpg

The &quot;SHANGO&quot; represents fire, thunder and lightning. In the caribbean yoruba religion, SHANGO lights up the darkness with lightning so followers can find their way, Shango also brings prosperity and good strategy to those deserving. Hey, you never know what extra goodies you may get with this very versitile, compact and well designed knife, by professional outdoors-man and survival instructor, Joe Flowers. This may be the perfect answer to those who like to have the ability to start their own fires, Joe has cleverly designed a small scraper at the back of the handle. This enables the user to scrape a small amount of magnesium in a pile and then effectively scrape the ferro rod, with a shower of sparks. Bottom line, you don't have to use or abuse your blade's cutting edge. This light weight knife is a joy to carry, around your neck, in your pocket, or even inside your hat...
