OB6-RTF-APM-VERSION	OB-6 Hexacopter RTF	Canada Drones is very proud to present you the Observer-6, our first in-house designed and produced Hexacopter. After years of experience with the other frames available on the market the decision to create our own custom frame from the ground up was quite easy. Canada Drones teamed up with Andre Verville from Kildir Technologies to create what is in our mind the perfect industrial platform to do land survey and inspection of any kind.The concept and design went through many iterations but the end goal was to produce a light frame strong enough to be called a TOOL and still powerful enough to lift a DSLR/FLIR/NIR/GoPro/... cameraNow sold with foldable legs (see below)It can easily be used to do: Police collision reports Search and Rescue Coast guard recon missions  Land surveys Aerial mapping Aerial Photo / Video  Agriculture Inspection Construction site monitoring  Basic requirement were dictated by you the customers: Always asking for something better than carbon fiber (it's nice, strong but when it breaks it's a mess and nothing survive!)  Light but not fragile Easy to use (still this should not be consider a beginner project, we expect you to have prior RC pilot skills... a DJI Phantom is a great tool to get you up to speed)  Vibration isolation (we did many levels of it!)  Able to mount any brand of Flight controllers, Camera, Gimbals, accessories...  Ready to fly and configured before delivery (Tested!)  Foldable to some extend (still requires tools but it does fold for ease of transportation) Honest design, made locally, with pride!  Affordable (this doesn't mean cheap parts!)  Easy to service / upgrade / work on... If you know multicopter you know they crash... you will need to fix them... this frame is design with that in mind)  Able to lift up to 5kg  Autonomous flight capabilities (well this is not dictated by the frame but the flight controller, we will be using the proven APM2.6 in most builds but DJI flight controllers...

CD-FRSKY-TARANIS-PLUS	FRSKY TARANIS - PLUS  (With X8R and Case)	The FrSky Taranis was amazing... now here comes the Taranis PLUSCurrent version in stock is B01, with SWR functionality.How does the Plus differ from the normal Taranis? The Plus versions has everything the normal Taranis includes plus a higher quality, better contrast LCD display with blue or AMBER backlighting, and haptic feedback built in. There is one item missing, the SWR check of the transmitter antenna is no longer available. You still get the great new sliders, the big low self discharge battery, and all of the other great things you have come to expect from FrSky. Want to quickly see the difference from the "old" version? Long push the menu button, then scroll down to the "color" setting and turn that up. The brightest setting is a nice orange color. I rather like it.Also comes with OpenTX version 2 installed Lua scripts in place and new model setup guide. Just try adding a new model, it is pretty nice for assigning channels.  It has a lot of other small changes in the firmware, best to read up on them all. The joystick feature is kind of nice. They do lack the SWR antenna check, but it will be available around Xmas, or early next year. If you could design your own transmitter, what would you include? That is exactly what FrSky asked their customers. The result is the Taranis! FrSky has succeeded in introducing a transmitter at an entry level price that outperforms many of the best name brand systems on the market. You may worry that the quality has been cut to keep prices down. Compromising quality for the sake of price is not the FrSky way. FrSky may lack a fancy ad campaign and huge marketing budget, but they do not skimp on the hardware! The most important aspect for any transmitter is maintaining a rock solid connection with the receiver. FrSky is well known for the frequency hopping ACCST technology taking advantage of the entire 2.4GHz band resulting in excellent range and reliability. FrSky knows many things can affect the connecti...		TX/RX	TX/RX	299.00	CDN	0	//cdn3.volusion.com/pfdxa.tbfnk/v/vspfiles/photos/CD-FRSKY-TARANIS-PLUS-2.jpg

Depending upon DJI's accumulation of historic and reliable information integration technology, the iOSD MARK II can grab the most accurate first-hand flight data information in the shortest possible time.REAL-TIME ACCURATE FLIGHT DATA & VIDEO SIGNAL SUPERPOSITIONThe DJI iOSD MARK II can collect real-time video and flight data, which will help you to obtain the aircraft status information during flight. It can display power voltage, flight velocity, height, distance from the home point, horizontal attitude and GPS satellite number, etc.SUPPORT DOUBLE VIDEO SOURCE INPUT, SWITCHABLE DURING FLIGHTThe DJI iOSD MARK II supports two video input sources: PAL or NTSC mode, which can be selected remotely by an R/C transmitter switch. By doing this the pilot can achieve double video alternation during flight and can also set one source for the aerial camera and the other one for FPV. This will ensure the nose direction of the aircraft is under control and a safety return during filming.REMOTE VIDEO LINK CHANNELS IN REAL-TIME SWITCHThe R/C TX switch can also change the wireless video transmitter channel remotely when user uses the wireless video transmitter designated by DJI. This design has brilliantly avoided the inconvenience of manual switch on the ...

AP-MINIOSD-3DR-1-1	3DR MinimOSD rev v1.1 kit	MinimOSD, an Arduino-based on-screen display board from 3DRoboticsIt's tailored for use with ArduPilot Mega and the MAVlink protocol, and designed to be as compact as possible. It's main components are an ATmega328P 8 bit microcontroller with an Arduino bootloader, and a MAX7456 monochrome on-screen display. Programming is done through an FTDI-compatible 6-pin cable.It features two independent power and ground sections to isolate the OSD's analog stage: a +5V section for the ATmega and the OSD's digital stage, powered through the FTDI cable or other +5V source; and a regulated +5V section for the OSD's analog stage, powered through the video in/out header and capable of handling up to +12V input. Solder jumpers are available to combine the two power and ground sections if desired.Starting on 4/30/2012, all boards are version 1.1, which reflects a change in the voltage regulator to deal with excessive heating issues.SpecificationsATmega328P with Arduino bootloaderMAX7456 monochrome on-screen displayFTDI cable compatible pinoutStandard 6-pin ISP headerTwo independent power sections with an LED indicator on eachSolder jumpers for combining the power sections+5V 500mA regulator for up to +12V supply inputSolder jumper for PAL video optionExposed test points for HSYNC and LOSDimensions: 0.7"W x 1.7"L (2.4" w/ pins as shown) x 0.3"HDocumentationSet up instructions are here.Eagle files are here.Dimensional drawings are here		Video / OSD	Video / OSD	66.99	CDN	10	//cdn3.volusion.com/pfdxa.tbfnk/v/vspfiles/photos/AP-MINIOSD-3DR-1-1-2.gif?1411560468	//cdn3.volusion.com/pfdxa.tbfnk/v/vspfiles/photos/AP-MINIOSD-3DR-1-1-3.gif?1411560468

3DR-PIXHAWK-AIRSPEED-06	Pixhawk Airspeed Sensor Kit	Pixhawk Airspeed Sensor KitThe Pixhawk digital differential airspeed sensor has a very low offset, a high resolution and, best of all, does not suffer from the noise induced by long cables and offsets in the ratio-metric output on the APM 2.6 analog airspeed sensor.Featuring a Measurement Specialties 4525DO sensor, with 1 psi measurement range (roughly up to 100 m/s or 360 km/h or 223 mp/h), the Pixhawk Airspeed Sensor Kit enables a resolution of 0.84 Pa, with data delivered at 14 bits from a 24 bit delta-sigma ADC. It also measures temperature to allow calculation of true airspeed from indicated airspeed using the MS5611 static pressure sensor on Pixhawk. Not influenced by the heat of nearby processing components, it is much closer to the air temperature than with previous analog sensor setups. Supported on all Pixhawk and PX4 autopilot generation boards, this kit comes with M3 / 6-32 mounting holes.Includes:Digital airspeed sensorRubber tubingPitot tubeFour-wire I2C cableView the online instructions here.

3DR-Y6-CONVERSION-KIT1	3DR Y6 Conversion kit	3DR Y6 copter conversion kitWe are pleased to offer you this simple, well-engineered kit for converting your 3DR hexacopter into a Y6 copter. Change your configuration, load Y6 firmware on to your APM, and you have a new machine!This is a kit for converting an existing 3DR Hexacopter into a new Y6. The image showing a completed conversion is for illustration only. Kit contents are described below.Coaxial motor mounting plates allow the attachment of a second motor below the existing motor. This means three arms can do the job of six!The co-located motors preserve thrust symmetry in the event of an individual motor failure. This redundant design means your Y6 will remain under control -- bringing you peace of mind for valuable payloads and critical missions.The wide viewing angle between the front arms makes the Y6 a perfect camera platform.A slight reduction in efficiency is offset by the weight savings of removing three arms from the frame. This also presents a smaller surface area, bringing better performance in windy conditions.This kit includes:6 x Co-Axial Motor Mounting Plates - New part6 x C-Type Landing Gear - New part12 x 19mm Hollow Spacers - New part12 x M3x25mm 316 Stainless Steel Metal Screw -12 x M3 Metal Hex Nut -24 x M3x5mm Black Nylon Screw -12 x M3x18mm Black Nylon Space -2 x pairs of counter rotating 11x4.7 propsWhat you'll need to complete this kit:Fully built 3DR hexacopterBattery and chargerRC Transmitter and receiverResourcesPDF assembly instructions:APM:Copter manualParameter file-3s batteryParameter file-4s batteryNote:The most efficient propeller setup for the Y6 uses 10x4.7 props on the top motors with 11x4.7 on the bottom.

X8R-16-WHISK	FrSky X8R - 16 CHANNEL, SBUS, SMART PORT RECEIVER (PCB Version)	FrSky's newest receiver features 16 channels (8 normal pwm outputs and all 16 channels on the dedicated Sbus output). Plus the exciting new Smart Port.Smaller than the previous 8 channel recievers, but now packing 16 channels and the new Smart Port that supports the new hubless digital sensors! Or, connect the new vario, and then connect the old hub to use existing analog sensors. A common question we get is how do you get all 16 channels out of the X8R? Well, FrSky has given you options. You can use the Sbus line to access all 16 channels. Using something like the FrSky Sbus Decoder, you can convert the digital Sbus signal to normal servo outputs. You can connect Sbus servos directly to the Sbus line, frSky will have several servo options very soon. Or you can combine 2 X8Rs and output channels 1-8 on the first receiver, and output 9-16 on the second receiver. But that isn't all the X8R can do. It can also work in "D8 Mode to work with the DHT, DJT, DFT and DHT-U transmitter modules. In this mode you have 8 channels. The neat trick is the Smart Port still works in D8 Mode!You are probably wondering about the new antennas on the X8R. FrSky refers to these as PCB antennas and report up to a 20% range increase over the standard antennas. Specification:Dimension: 46.5mm x 27mm x 14.4mm (1.83" x 1.06" x .56")Weight: 16.8g (.59 oz)Operating Voltage Range: 4V-10.0VOperating Current: 100mA@5V Operating Range: 1.5km (Full Range)RSSI output: analog voltage output (0~3.3V)FirmwareUpgradeable Compatibility:All 16 channels require the FrSky Taranis, or the XJT module.For 8 channels in D8 Mode you can use the FrSky Taranis or XJT, DJT, DFT, DHT and DHT-U modules.Nice little twist for APM users (or anyone in need for 16 channels mapped to 2 different things) X8R is 16 channel receiver. But it has 8 pins (outputs only). Using configuration steps provided in the X8R 8 manual you can select, whether on the 8 pins you going to have Ch1 through 8, or Ch9 through 16....

XTREAMBEEBOARD	XtreamBee Board (No XBee included)	This is the most advanced and competitive XBee interface board you will find! It's breadboard compatible, has 4 status LED's (one selectable to display ASC or RSSI), built-in 3.3V power regulator, configuration solder jumpers and an unique feature that allows you set the device as Master or Slave FTDI mode with a simple slide of a switch!In master mode you will be able to attach any USB FTDI cable/board and send/receive data like the rest of the average XBee adapters do (normal use mode), but if you slide the switch to "Slave mode" you will be able to attach the XtreamBee to any FTDI compatible device, like Arduinos, ArduIMU and Ardupilots. So you only need two XtreamBees, to create the Master-Slave connection enabling two-way wireless FTDI communication (or one XtreamBee set in "Slave Mode", if you already have another third party XBee adapter). You can even tweak the board to emulate in a wireless fashion a CTS and RTS signals.Features-Includes 2 x 2 mm female receptor headers to correctly place the XBee module.-Includes 1x right angle 6 position male pin headers.-3.3V regulator built-in.-ON Led, Tx/Rx Led's, ASC and RSSI Led (Jumper selectable).-Master/Slave selector-Solder jumper allows you to supply the board directly with 3.3V (Only recommended in Slave Mode).-Breadboard compatible!-Screw holes for easy mounting.-Inexpensive!-Weight: 0.1 oz; 3 g-Xbee module not included.Resources-Eagle Files!-Set up instructions.

Do not buy cheap imitations from unknown companies, Maytech is proud of the quality produced and they display their brand on them. No brand name means potential bad quality. Maytech Carbon fiber upgrade props are the next step in performance. Due to popular demand I decided to stock these and will keep them coming. They are great props but you need to know how to use them. 9450 means more agressive than the previous 9433, will produce more thrust and less vibration. Expect a lot more thrust and response with them, First flights go easy to understand the new flying characteristics.Also be extremely cautious with these and please remove them when not in use. They will do more then cutting you a bit, this is amputation risks written all over.As usual inspect props for damages before each flight and replace if damaged (even more important for carbon props) Yes they are self-tightening just like your regular props! Works also for Phantom 1 (requires self tightening motors) will give you more power and flight time!Includes: (2 props 9450)1 CW 1 CCWWeight is 12 grams each (just like stock props)		Motors, ESC, Props	Motors, ESC, Props	25.99	CDN	82	//cdn3.volusion.com/pfdxa.tbfnk/v/vspfiles/photos/DD-P2-MAY-PROP9450-CF-2.jpg

SFE-CURRENT-90A	AttoPilot Voltage and Current Sense Breakout - 90A	Description: This is a small voltage and current sense PCB. DC current is determined by measuring a voltage drop across a pair of parallel 1 mOhm shunt resistors, then converted to a final analog voltage output by the TI INA-169. Voltage sense is accomplished by scaling to 3.3V ADC range by a precision resistor divider.The PCB is supplied without leads or connectors. The pad sizes are large enough to accommodate 12 gauge heavy duty leads (see datasheet) but care must be exercised in soldering. Smaller gauge leads are considerably easier to solder without creating shorts.Features:51.8V Max89.4A MaxVery low zero current offsetAnalog output scaled for 3.3V ADCSelf PoweredDimensions: 4 x 15 x 19mmHow to connect to APM?

US-FTDI-5V	FTDI Cable 5V	Description: The FTDI cable is a USB to Serial (TTL level) converter which allows for a simple way to connect TTL interface devices to USB. The I/O pins of this FTDI cable are configured to operate at 5V.The FTDI cable is designed around an FT232RQ, which is housed in a USB A connector. The other side of the cable is terminated with a 0.1" pitch, 6-pin connector with the following pinout: RTS, RX, TX, 5V, CTS, GND (RTS is the green cable and GND is black).This cable has the same pinout and functionality as our FTDI Basic Breakout board; you can use it to program your Arduino Pro, Pro Mini and Lilypad. For use with those boards, align the black and green wires of the FTDI cable with the 'BLK' and 'GRN' labels on the PCB.There are pros and cons to the FTDI Cable vs the FTDI Basic. The FTDI Basic has great LED indicators, but requires a Mini-B cable. The FTDI Cable is well protected against the elements, but is large and cannot be embedded into a project as easily. The FTDI Basic uses DTR to cause a hardware reset where the FTDI cable uses the RTS signal.
