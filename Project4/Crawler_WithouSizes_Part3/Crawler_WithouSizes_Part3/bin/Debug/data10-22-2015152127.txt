DJI-S1000-A2-Z15	DJI S1000 Premium Octocopter + A2 and Z15	DJI S1000 Premium + A2 + Z15 Combo (Canon 5D Mark II/III or Panasonic GH3 or Black Magic Pocket Camera BMPCC) indicate gimbal option at checkout SPARKPROOF PLUG Its main power cord uses an AS150 sparkproof plug and an XT150 plug, preventing creators from mixing up polarity when plugging in the battery and preventing short circuits.  Low Gimbal Mounting PositionThe gimbal is mounted low on the frame on a specially designed bracket. When combined with our retractable landing gear, it offers a clear and wide shooting angle.

3DR-GPS-LEA-6-COMPASS	3DR uBlox GPS with Compass Kit (for APM 2.6 and up)	This new design incorporates the HMC5883L digital compass, providing a convenient method of mounting the compass away from sources of interference that may be present in the confines of the vehicle. This is our best GPS module, significantly outperforming the Mediatek GPS due to the larger antenna and next-gen chipset. An excellent solution for multicopters and rovers in particular, where GPS accuracy is paramount. It features active circuitry for the ceramic patch antenna, rechargeable backup battery for warm starts, and I2C EEPROM for configuration storage. The units ship pre-configured for use with 3DR APM 2.6 autopilot; the configuration file is available in the repository.Works perfectly with the Pixhawk, use the cable provided with the pixhawk that has DF13 6 pins to 6 pins connector for the pixhawk, otherwise the 5 to 6 pin wire is good for APM 2.6 users.
