GS75008	Castle Panic	The forest is filled with all sorts of Monsters. They watched and waited as you built your Castle and trained your soldiers but now they've gathered their army and are marching out of the woods. Can you work with your friends to defend your Castle against the horde or will the Monsters tear down your Walls and destroy the precious Castle Towers? You will all win or lose together but in the end only one player will be declared the Master Slayer! Castle Panic is a cooperative light strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up. Players must work together to defend their castle in the center of the board from monsters that attack out of the forest at the edges of the board. Players trade cards hit and slay monsters and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win.	<ul><li>Details            Contents1 Game board1 Rulebook49 Castle Cards49 Monster Tokens ( see Token set )6 Walls6 Towers1 Tar Token2 Fortify Tokens6 Order of Play Cards12 Plastic Stands1 Die</li><li>Year of Release 2009</li><li>Ages 10 and up</li><li>Designer Justin De Witt</li><li>Genre Casual</li><li>Minimum Players 1 Player</li><li>Maximum Players 6 Players</li><li>Playing Time 60 Minutes</li></ul>	Fireside Games	Fireside Games	34.99	CDN	5	http://gameshack.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/500x500/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/a/castle_panic.jpg
