CHCHCHHHS_337	Cooksville Hawaiian Heat Hot Sauce	Hawaiian Heat Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) This was a no brainer for us. Watching our kids order pizza one night (we have six boys so there's always a lot of variation on the pizza theme) we noticed that the twins had a penchant for pineapple and hot peppers on theirs. Taking this idea (minus the pizza) and turning into a hot sauce we scored a winner. We even grew a crop of peppers native to the islands to get an idea about the flavour. We have been told that this sauce works on everything from fruit salad (no kidding!) to baked ham. Recently we were in a bar in Streetsville, Ontario and they brought us a plate of wings with our sauce on it. It tasted amazing. Try your own variation and let us know.

CHCHCUSHS_344	Cooksville UK Style Hot Sauce	UK Style Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) I tried a home made concoction once at a World Cup Soccer party that a British friend of mine was throwing. I am not sure of what kind of peppers it had in it, but mustard was a key ingredient, and this was the condiment for the â€œbangers and mashâ€ he was serving. It nearly took my head off. We decided to take this concept to the next level and came up with our own version. Use this where ever you would use mustard but require a little more â€œfireâ€.

CHCHCBSHS_363	Cooksville Bulgarian Style Hot Sauce	Bulgarian Style Hot Sauce (5 oz/150 ml) We were on a trip to Bulgaria in 2007 and I noted the use of certain spices, predominantly mountain grown savory, in most of the dishes we were served. I tried adding these to peppers and came up with a pretty good sauce. My lovely wife Mariana, who hails from that region, said that adding tomatoes would bring out the taste I was looking for. Before I could even attempt to put a case together about how the sauce was good as is, she had added her magic touches and came up with this recipe. Mariana's mom, Yovka, has a trademark recipe that blends tomatoes, cumin and hand rubbed savory which adds just the perfect amount of pizzazz to any of the amazing dishes she creates. This is another unique sauce that goes great with pretty much everything. The label features the Bulgarian national colors and coat of arms.

CHCHGW4PGB_535	Get Wasted - 4 Pack Gift Box	Get Wasted includes: Arrogant Double Bastard Double Burn Habañero Hot Sauce - 6 oz.- A sauce almost as big as the beer that's in it - ALMOST. Merciful beings that we are we chose to utilize none other than Habañeros to dilute it. If you're tasting this hot sauce as you read this you either love Habañeros or you just lost a bet. (Not yet personally familiar with Habañeros? No matter, it's a s-h-o-r-t learning curve). Double Bastard Ale Double Burn Habañero is a surprisingly well balanced hot sauce to those fire eaters who love Habañeros, and a singular pain to those who are unworthy. "Introduced in 1997, Arrogant Bastard Ale immediately developed a following among "those who know" (a.k.a. "the Worthy"). Arrogant Bastard Ale is an aggressive beer and not for the timid or weak. As such, it demands pairing with food that takes the same stance. So when our similarly (and appropriately) arrogant friends at Carlsbad Gourmet approached us to collaborate on a hot sauce recipe made with Arrogant Bastard, not only did we say yes - we said, "Let's make three!" From California Ingredients:Double Bastard Ale, tomato paste, vinegar, honey, lemon juice, evaporated cane juice, salt, garlic powder, crushed red peppers, Capsicum, Habañero pepper powder, soybean oil. Wild Turkey Habañero Hot Sauce - 6oz. - The famous name on this bottle comes from a group of wild turkey hunters, one of whom brought a special barrel-aged bourbon on their annual hunting trip. In later years they always requested "that Wild Turkey bourbon" and today it is still hand-crafted in the same slow traditional way. It also perfectly enhances this real Kentucky fiery Habañero sauce, which is made with the finest ingredients. From Kentucky Ingredients: Cayenne peppers, Habañero peppers, Jalapeño peppers, vinegar, tomato paste, Wild Turkey Bourbon, sugar, salt, natural flavorings, garlic. Lynchburg Tennessee Whiskey Jalapeño Hot Sauce - 6 oz. - The folks of Lynchburg have really done it this time. ...				44.95	CDN	Y	//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0188/0032/products/e07c1208b81a1a78e6537c3d3361c1eb_large.jpeg?v=1427590732

CHCHJOHICS_701	Jekyll or Hyde Insane Chilli Sauce	...alone in the laboratory the doctors experiment was complete. Dare she try the potion? Why not, what harm could it do...the reaper was soon to possess another brave soul... © Grim Reaper Foods Ltd 2011  You decide the heat in this potentially insanely hot chilli sauce - This baby was invented for a bacon sarnie and pulled pork and is a firm favourite in the Reapers fridge. Only the finest red jalapenos are taken to be chipotle chillies, they are left on the plant to the last moment, and smoked for a good 24 hours. They can be hot or cold smoked, and then dehydrated. Ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 SHU they aren't the punch of a Serrano, but the flavour is what you are looking for, and this sauce packs it in. Not enough heat for you, I thought of that too! Dr Jekyll as you know turned himself insane with a potion, which I have named Elixer 13 which you get with the sauce, (I know Elixir is spelt like this, I'm just being different for the Elixer) 1/2 million SHU in a dripper bottle, which enables you to carry out your own experiments in regard to heating your sauce to the border of insanity! A family of four can enjoy the same sauce at different heat levels by heating their own portion! I'm pleased to say that Jekyll or Hyde...You Decide was WINNER OF 2 GOLD STARS AT THE GREAT TASTE AWARDS 2012 Handmade in Hertfordshire, England. 100mls/3.4floz + 5mls/0.165floz  HOT CHILLI SAUCE MADE WITH CHIPOTLE CHILLIES - INGREDIENTS : Red Peppers, White Wine Vinegar, Water, Chipotle Chilli, Golden Syrup, Red Onion, Garlic, Salt, Oil, Citric Acid.
