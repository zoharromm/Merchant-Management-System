"Lync 26"" Convertible BackPack + Rolling Luggage_Blue"	luggage	Eagle Creek	Eagle Creek	667562544887	UPC	JET20516-BLUE	JET20516-BLUE	The definition of a convertible wheeled backpack has changed with the all new Lync luggage from Eagle Creek™! Unlike traditional wheeled backpacks  the wheels and handle system can actually be removed from the bag and disassembled to save space and weight from your back! The Lync starts with a traditional main bag that can convert into a backpack thanks to the removable  padded shoulder straps (with sternum support) - and can convert even more into a wheeled upright by quickly assembling the frame and mounting the bag to it featuring a full telescopic handle that can lock at multiple position depending on your height  rugged all terrain wheels that can navigate the road ahead  and corner and bumper guards that help protect your bag during your travels.  Best of all the entire system collapses into a stowable bag for easier storage at home or for bringing along with you when in need of extra packing space!  The large main compartment features compression straps to secure your clothes while travelling to avoid shifting and wrinkling during transit. There is a large internal mesh pocket for sorting clothes or placing a Pack-It™ folder. A large external pocket can be used for magazines or files and a small pocket found on the top of the bag can be used for storing commonly used travel items like your passport and travel documents.		466.11	CAD					99																			0	LB																6303806011		"Patent-pending Connect-It™ Technology: Collapses flat and disassembles for convenient storage in small stuff sac and features ultra-light frame with durable wheels and retractable handle.Built to last: Supreme durability with premium materials, rigorously tested for high strength-to-weight ratio, and large diameter aluminum frame worthy of No Matter What™ Warranty.Built-in durability: ExpandStand™ hinged foot, bumper protection, sturdy wheel housing and reinforced bartacks."
